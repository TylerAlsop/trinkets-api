# trinkets-api

Used this repository to run a codesandbox for the lesson on HTTP/AJAX II.

Cloned this respository.
npm install-ed.
npm start-ed.
Checked to see that the api was working by going to the localhost:3333 in the browser. 
    (The reccommended url was "http://localhost:3333/itemById/0").

The codesandbox used was "https://codesandbox.io/s/trinkets-httpajax-ii-webpt12-24r3l"

I cloned the sandbox after the lesson.
