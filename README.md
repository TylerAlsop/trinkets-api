# trinkets-api

Used this repository to run this codesandbox for the lesson on HTTP/AJAX II:
"https://github.com/TylerAlsop/trinkets-api"

Cloned this respository.
npm install-ed.
npm start-ed.
Checked to see that the api was working by going to the localhost:3333 in the browser.
(The reccommended url was "http://localhost:3333/itemById/0").

The codesandbox used was, "https://codesandbox.io/s/trinkets-httpajax-ii-webpt12-24r3l".

I forked the sandbox after the lesson.
The url to my forked copy of the sandbox is, "https://codesandbox.io/s/trinkets-httpajax-ii-webpt12-kuohn".
